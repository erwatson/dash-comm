        <h1>A communication app for people who can't speak or use their hands.</h1>
        <p>Introducing Dash Communication - an iPad app created specifically for people who need to communicate the most, but have difficluties doing so.</p> 
      </div>
      <div class="sign-up">
        <h1>Launching soon on Kickstarter!</h1>
        <p>Dash is currently in prototype development and testing in hospitals and beyond. Simply sign up below to find out when we launch on kickstarter so you can help the cause and get the Dash app first at a discount.</p>

      <div class="how-it-works">
        <h1>Dash makes selecting keywords and "writing" anything with the alphabet simple by breaking everything down into four directional buttons.</h1>
        <p>Almost all people who can't speak or use their hands can still indicate all four directions: Up, Down, Left, Right. So, we've broken down communication to be that simple.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="story">
        <p>Pic of me here, want to make personal connection - not corporate play, but personal and emotional connection with audience.</p>
        <h1>Hi, I'm Eric. An awesome team and myself (along with super generous support) are creating Dash to fill a clear need of a few people that could use a little help.</h1>
        <p>A few weeks back, a close family member of mine was in an accident leaving 70% of his body burned. Thankfully, he is one of the strongest, most determined, and family-loving people I know, so he's fighting like a true champ in his recovery process.</p>
        <h1>Not being able to communicate sucks.</h1>
        <p>Unfortunately, he has spent over a week intubated, meaning he had tubes in his mouth that don't allow him to talk. Also, his hands were burned pretty bad and he hasn't been able to use them yet. Throughout the entire process his mind has stayed sharp and he's completely with it.<br> Most people who are intubated get a communication board or app that they can touch to communicate needs and other basic words and phrases. If your hands aren't an option either - there isn't an option for communication right now. </p>
        <h3>80% of intubated patients in the ICU were moderately or extremely bothered by not being able to talk. Now imaging not being able to use hands to help communicate either.</h3>
        <h1>"APP FOR ERIC COMMUNICATE"</h1>
        <p>We created an extremely simple communication system for my family member using a poster board, sharpie, and lots of patience. He was really excited to communicate for the first time in days and the first thing he said... "APP FOR ERIC COMMUNICATE." That's right, his first thought and wish was not for himself, but he wanted an app to exist for people in his situation to be able to communicate. So, we've been working on it since.</p>
        <h1>Prototype testing results</h1>
        <p>We've created a simple website app to prototype the Dash app and the results are awesome! Testing has gone extremely well, and watching people's faces light up when being able to commnicate for the first time in too long makes everything worth while.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="next-steps">
        <h1>What we're doing to make a change!</h1>
        <p>We've created a Non-Profit called DASH. This Dash Communication iPad app is our first project targeting a specific underserved accessibility need. After that, we'd like to improve on the Dash app of course as well as tackle more accessibility issues for underserved groups of people that can be helped a little with targeted technology.</p>
